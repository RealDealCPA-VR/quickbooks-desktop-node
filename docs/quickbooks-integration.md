# QuickBooks Integration Capabilities

This document details how to use the QuickBooks integration features provided by the project.

## QuickBooks Integration Overview
The integration supports a wide range of QuickBooks business operations, including:

1. **Invoices**
2. **Bills**
3. **Checks**
4. **Customers**
5. **Vendors**
6. **Inventory Items**
7. **Journal Entries**
8. **Purchase Orders**
9. **Sales Orders**
10. **Transactions**

## API Endpoints

The project exposes a REST API for interacting with QuickBooks data. The API documentation is accessible at `/api-docs`.

### Example Endpoint Usage

**List Customers**
```bash
GET /api/qbd/customers
```
Response:
```json
{
  "customers": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Create Invoice**
```bash
POST /api/qbd/invoices
```
Request Body:
```json
{
  "customer_id": "1",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "due_date": "2025-10-01"
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
   - Tokens must be included in request headers

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced
   - Ensure appropriate permissions are set in QuickBooks

3. **Data Validation**
   - All input data is validated
   - Sanitized to prevent injection attacks

## Error Handling

The integration provides detailed error responses, including:

- HTTP Status Code
- Error Type
- Error Message
- Details (optional)

## Logging

Extensive logging is implemented to track:

- API Requests/Responses
- Business Object Operations
- System Events
- Errors/Warnings

## Customization

The project allows for customizing integration points and extending functionality by:

1. **Adding New Endpoints**
   - Extend the existing API to add new business object operations
2. **Modifying Existing Logic**
   - Customize data processing logic as needed
3. **Implementing Custom Handlers**
   - Add custom business logic for specific operations
