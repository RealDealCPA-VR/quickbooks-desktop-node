## Security Features

1. Authentication
   The integration implements proper authentication mechanisms to ensure secure communication with QuickBooks.

2. Authorization
   Role-based access controls are implemented to restrict operations based on user permissions.

3. Data Validation
   All input data is thoroughly validated to prevent invalid or malformed data from entering the system.

## Development and Testing

1. Comprehensive Testing
   The project includes an extensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability and functionality.

2. Build Scripts
   Automated build and deployment scripts are provided to streamline the development and release process.
